# End user video experience modelling


### Question A: Network side estimation end-user video experience modeling

With the upgrading of wireless broadband network and the popularity of intelligent terminals, more and more users choose to watch network videos on mobile intelligent terminals with application client APP, which is a TCP-based video transmission and playback. The two key indicators for network video to affect user experience are the initial buffer waiting time and the lag buffer time in the process of video playback. We can use the initial buffer delay and the proportion of lag time (lag time ratio = lag time/video playback time) to quantitatively evaluate user experience. Some studies have shown that the main factors that affect the initial buffer delay and the proportion of cache time are the initial buffer peak rate, the average download rate of playback phase, the end to end loop back time (E2E RTT), and video parameters. However, the relationship between these factors and the initial delay and the proportion of catton time is not clear.
According to the experimental data provided in the attachment, please try to establish the functional relationship between the user experience evaluation variables (initial buffer delay, proportion of cache time) and the network side variables (initial buffer peak rate, average download rate during playback phase, E2E RTT).
